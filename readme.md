I've decided to minimize distractions and create a homepage,
the thing to always open up first when launching a browser.
 making it minimal and putting all the good links with some styling into it is key.
  Also 24/7 chill beats to study/relax by is also in.
  Oh and I've got some fake links set up on my local network hosted via apache2!

These links are just templates, though if you ever visit my local network they surprisingly work!
